## 🚀 Pro Tips

💡 **Better Questions, Better Answers**
- Be specific: "What are the 3 main conclusions?" vs "Tell me about this"
- Use context: "Based on the methodology section, how was data collected?"
- Follow up: "Can you elaborate on the second point?"

🎯 **Optimize Performance**
- Start with smaller PDFs to test
- Use descriptive session IDs for organization
- Ask one question at a time for best results

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

✅ **What's Safe**
- Your PDFs are processed locally
- Only questions (not content) are sent to AI
- No permanent storage of your documents
